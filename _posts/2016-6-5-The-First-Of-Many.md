The cat is out of the bag. Brad and I have sold our home, packed our stuff into a metal box, put in our notices at work and have decided to put on a couple of backpacks and experience the world. We are excited, to say the least.

There is a lot to do between now and our departure date, July 25th, 2016. For us, it will be a rollercoaster finalizing our preparations for living our nomadic lifestyle.

We are two en route to blog our future.
