“How did it get so late so soon?” ― Dr. Seuss

Sometimes experiencing the places we visit is not all about waking up early and rushing around to see the top 10 attractions people say you must see. Sometimes the best way to truly experience the city we are in is to see it when the sun has set and the stars have begun to shine. 

On one of our days in Prague, Czech Republic, we decided to relax and saved up our daily quota of steps for roaming the city after dark. This is when the real beauty of the city came to life!

Living Prague late at night gave us a new appreciation for the wonder of the city. Not only is the capital of Czech Republic a unique gem of pre-war history during the daylight, it has a majestic power that enveloped us after hours. 

We are two en route to stay up late and see the lights of the city.
