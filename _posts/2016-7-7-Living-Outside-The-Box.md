We have been asked by multiple friends, family, and coworkers what we did with all of our stuff. Well...

A few weeks ago we sold our home and moved most of our possessions into a metal box and now we are living in a hotel with our two dogs and a few possessions. We are quite literally living outside of the box and couldn't be happier! 

While we had a lot of happy memories in our home, it was not the brick-and-mortar structure that brought us that happiness, rather it was the shared experiences we had while living at that address.

A few years ago we took a spur of the moment road trip across Texas and ended up sleeping in the back of our car. It was a great trip filled with lots of memories, none of which had anything to do with the roof over our head and everything to do with the experiences shared with one another.

There is something oddly comforting with not being tied down by a house and all the possessions within. The past few weeks have been liberating. No more spending days doing the mundane chores that come with owning a home, rather, we have had more time to get up and experience the world around us.  

We are two en route for more shared experiences.
