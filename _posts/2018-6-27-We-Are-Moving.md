title: New Home, Cheaper Rent
---

Squarespace is a great platform for sharing and updating content, but it also comes at a price. To cut costs where possible, twoenroute.com will be moving to its new home as a GitHub page. The main reason for the move is simple, cost. GitHub pages are free and it’s quick to get started, just follow the steps outlined on the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

As we approach the two year anniversary of departing on our trip, we thought it would be a great time to start transcribing our trip journals, day-by-day starting 7/26/2018.
If you don’t already follow us on social media, find the links to do so at the bottom of this page. If you’re looking forward to reading along as we share our journal be sure to add us to your favorite RSS reader.
